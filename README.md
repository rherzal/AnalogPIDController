# This is the main repository for my measurements and actuators semester project

The project is a full design and implementation of an analog PID controller pcb, using only operational amplifiers for calculations, used to control a DC motor.

It uses 3 potentiometers for setting the 3 controller constants, one potentiometer for setting the command signal, and one potentiometer for angular feedback.

The PCB was manufactured with the help of a local electronics company from Baia Mare, [circuite-imprimate.ro](https://circuite-imprimate.ro/).
